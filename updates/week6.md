## What we’ve been up to​ this week​

* Its been another busy week but everything feels like it is now coming together

* Further developments to the system have been completed and we are really pleased with how its looking now we are nearing the end of the project
* We completed the user research with 21 users. All provided really positive feedback on how simple and easy the system will be to use and how much of a difference it would make to them (particularly ICS)
* Feedback on system design has been used to make immediate changes to the apps. Some has been used to create a backlog for future development
* We have completed a comparison between the telephone numbers in the Rant and Rave system with those from Azure and obtained a good match rate

* Work on SMS sending via Notify using queues and handling delivery receipts

## What we’re planning for ​next week

* Further work to complete some of the changes users suggested using user research 
* We will complete some testing to ensure that there are no issues with the system sending messages out to multiple contacts
* We will plan and schedule in a show and tell to present what we have done those that are interested
