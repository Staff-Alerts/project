# Staff Alerts Final Update
**16 November 2020** 

Prepared by: Polly Sait

## What we’ve been up to​ in the last couple of weeks​

* Final changes to the sites have been completed following feedback from users
* Created some admin pages so the user can perform updates to the contact lists and check success rates
* We have started to carry out some testing to ensure there are no major bugs or resilience issues 
* Contacted over 60 members of staff with incorrect mobile telephone numbers in Outlook/SOP. We have had a great response back with staff confirming they have updated their details
* Continued discussions with Data Protection Team 
* We now have 3 environments: Training, Development and Live
* Finished the MVP+1 backlog that shows additional work that needs to be carried out to improve the service further
* Further work to finalise handover documentation to the business

## What we’re planning for the future

Show and tell sessions to present what we have done to various parties have been organised between now and the beginning of December. During these sessions we will present the 'get' and 'send' alerts sites, describe how we've designed them, summarise the feedback we received from users and discuss what decisions need to be made before any further work can start.

## Retrospective

We have been holding weekly retrospective meetings throughout the project to reflect on whats gone well, what isn't working and how/if we need to change the way we work. We have had the last of these meetings now and we reflected on the project as a whole. We can discuss this in more detail at a later date but we believe this project has been a great example of where we can create something amazing by being focussed, resourceful, flexible and trusting in each other.
